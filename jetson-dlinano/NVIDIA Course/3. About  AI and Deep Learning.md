### AI and Deep Learning

  > [What the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?](https://blogs.nvidia.com.tw/2016/07/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/)  
  >>We can say Deep Learning is include in Machine Learning and both of them are Artificial Intelligence.  
  >>Machine Learning need human to feature extraction but Deep Learning can feature extraction by itself. 
 
  
  ## Machine Learning (機器學習)
  A branch of AI to generalize and classify images based on experience in the form of lots of example data.  
  `資料 -> 特徵擷取(人) -> 模型 -> 答案`
  
  ## Deep Learning (深度學習)
  A Technique for Implementing Machine Learning.  
  `資料 -> 特徵擷取(自學) -> 模型 -> 答案`
  
  ## Deep Learning Models
  A Deep Learning model consists of a neural network with internal parameters.   
    
  ## Train
  When we training the Multiple labeled examples, we must Labeled the examples iteratively.
   
  ## weights (權重)
  If the network gets the "wrong" answer and the label doesn't match, adjusts the weights a little bit.

  ## Inference
  Once the model is trained, it can be run on live data and provide results in real time.
