# JetCam

JetCam is an easy to use Python camera interface for NVIDIA Jetson.

*  Works with various USB and CSI cameras using Jetson's [Accelerated GStreamer Plugins](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/embedded/L4T/r32_Release_v1.0/Docs/Accelerated_GStreamer_User_Guide.pdf?uIzwdFeQNE8N-vV776ZCUUEbiJxYagieFEqUoYFM9XSf9tbslxWqFKnVHu8erbZZS20A7ADAIgmSQJvXZTb0LkuGl9GoD5HJz4263HcmYWZW0t2OeFSJKZOfuWZ-lF51Pva2DSDtu2QPs-junm7BhMB_9AMQRwExuDb5zIhf_o8PIbA4KKo)
*  Easily read images as ``numpy`` arrays with ``image = camera.read()``

*  Set the camera to ``running = True`` to attach callbacks to new frames

JetCam makes it easy to prototype AI projects in Python, especially within the Jupyter Lab programming environment installed in [JetCard](http://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard).

If you find an issue, please [let us know](../..//issues)!

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcam
cd jetcam
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

> JetCam is tested against a system configured with the [JetCard](http://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard) setup.  Different system configurations may require additional steps.

## Usage

Below we show some usage examples.  You can find more in the [notebooks](notebooks).

### Create CSI camera

Call ``CSICamera`` to use a compatible CSI camera.  ``capture_width``, ``capture_height``, and ``capture_fps`` will control the capture shape and rate that images are aquired.  ``width`` and ``height`` control the final output shape of the image as returned by the ``read`` function.

```python
from jetcam.csi_camera import CSICamera

camera = CSICamera(width=224, height=224, capture_width=1080, capture_height=720, capture_fps=30)
```

### Create USB camera

Call ``USBCamera`` to use a compatbile USB camera.  The same parameters as ``CSICamera`` apply, along with a parameter ``capture_device`` that indicates the device index.  You can check the device index by calling ``ls /dev/video*``.

```python
from jetcam.usb_camera import USBCamera

camera = USBCamera(capture_device=1)
```

### Read

Call ``read()`` to read the latest image as a ``numpy.ndarray`` of data type ``np.uint8`` and shape ``(224, 224, 3)``.  The color format is ``BGR8``.

```python
image = camera.read()
```

The ``read`` function also updates the camera's internal ``value`` attribute.

```python
camera.read()
image = camera.value
```

### Callback

You can also set the camera to ``running = True``, which will spawn a thread that acquires images from the camera.  These will update the camera's ``value`` attribute automatically.  You can attach a callback to the value using the [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#callbacks-when-trait-attributes-change) library.  This will call the callback with the new camera value as well as the old camera value

```python
camera.running = True

def callback(change):
    new_image = change['new']
    # do some processing...

camera.observe(callback, names='value')
```

### CSI Cameras

These cameras work with the [``CSICamera``](jetcam/csi_camera.py) class.  Try them out by following the example [notebook](notebooks/csi_camera/csi_camera.ipynb).
